# COMP130 - Reflective Journal to Accompany My CPD Report

You should reflect across the first 13 weeks of the course. This is the period from induction week to the Winter vacation. In your reflections, you should try to identify at least one challenge that you experienced and/or obstacle that you encountered that week. Consider which skills and/or characteristics that challenge/obstacle relates to. 

This will prove to be a considerable aid when you need to identify the most important areas of personal development in your report. Do try to keep up by completing an entry in the journal every week.

## Week 0

Meeting the team and game concepts

I was very anxious to meet the team as i struggle with meeting new people due to my anxiety. I thought to myself i would tackle this situation by not backing down to any ideas i had or complimenting and encouraging other peoples ideas if i too liked them. The team had many different ideas that we liked so it wasn't easy to just pick a game we all liked the idea of, so we decided to give it a week so we can really flesh out our game ideas with mechanics, art design, narratives etc.

## Week 1

Deciding on the game and working on protoypes 

This week we finally decided on what our game was going to be. We wanted a 4 player couch shooter with a unique bullet mechanic where when a player fires, everyone else gets another bullet. We decided the art style would a be a neon cyber punk aesthetic similar to things like tron. One of the challenges that we discovered was how we were going to prototype the game. So Sam decided that all the programmers should make their own version of the game and whoever game was the best, we work from that one. we had a week to do this.

## Week 2

Prototyping the game

This week i started my prototype for the game. I had a big problem with this has i didnt know how to code in unreal so i had to use tutorials from youtube. I was able to get a basic version of the game but because Sam was also following the same tutorial and had extra features added in i.e animations etc. we decided to go with his prototype. Once this was decided we started discussing on what mechanics needed to be added first, Sam was gonna start converting all the blueprint code into c++ while i prototype little mechanics like dashing using blue prints.

## Week 3

Adding little mechanics to the game.

This week didn't start so well for me as it was my birthday and i went a little too crazy the night before, meaning i was too sick to work on the game. I learned from this challenge by learning drink moderation so im not a hindrance on the team. However i was able to create the dashing mechanic for the game which worked really well. Once this was added i started experimenting with a knock back mechanic adding it to the dash, however this did not test well as it felt too janky and just a weird experience.

## Week 4

unfortunately i cant remember what i did this week. so in the future i will prevent this by writing about my experiences every friday 

## Week 5

Snow week and Software engineering questions

This week in snowed in Falmouth, so i decided to take advantage of this rare opportunity and enjoy the snow. this means for the days it did snow i didn't do any work for the game project apart from watching unreal videos for research purposes. this week we also had our software engineering proposals due and i really struggled to come up with a question because i was unsure of what the essay was about, i over came this challenge by asking many of my peers what their questions was to give me a rough idea about what i could ask, in the end my question was "how do developers determine whether their game login systems are suï¬ƒciently secure?"

## Week 6

Working on the game and discussing c++ over blue prints 

This week Sam and I talked about if we should code the game in C++ or just use blueprints. the pros to using C++ is that it gives us the knowledge of the languae which we could apply in other situations. the cons was it was going to take us a lot longer as we didnt know the langauge. The pros to using blue prints is that its alot easier for us to make mechanics and prototype features. the cons is that we can only use blue prints within unreal. In the end we decided to just work within blueprints because that way we can actually make the game within the timeframe given.

## Week 7

Show en tell day and Software engineering presentations

This week we had the show en tell day which i was really looking forward to because i was i excited to see the games in other years and see how far they have come. it was also really interesting to see how far the games in 1st year have come as i have not had the opportunity to see some of their games. This week we also had our engineering presentations which i totally forgot about as i was too occupied working on the game project. this means my presentation was pretty crap. Next time i will learn to prioritize other assignments so i dont tunnel vision 

# Week 8

Essay week

This week we had the essay peer review. My essay didn't come out as well as i hoped due to the fact my essay question wast very specific and i struggled to find academic resources. i feel like essays are a weak spot for me as i seem to struggle to find academic resources because im never too sure what references to search for and i also struggle to read the papers once i find them due to lack of concentration. so in the future to over come this i will read the papers in short burst so i dont keep losing concentration, i know this will take me longer to finish the paper but at least it would be finished.

## Week 9

Coming back from easter

when i came back from the easter brake i was very behind on the game because i didnt have my computer with me so i couldnt commit any work to the project. i will try to overcome this by making sure i have some kind of device where i can do work and commit to the project. Sam had told me the catch mechanic has replaced the bullet generation mechanic due to better play testing as well other bullet types. I was still adding little mechanics to the game such as the ammo pick up which was the foundation for the special bullets that Sam added to the game. Sam also wanted me to work on particle effects for the dashing but i struggled to do this as i didnt know cascade very well. i tried to overcome this by watching videos but it took me too long to grasp.

## Week 10

Impending doom 

This week i discovered the Arduino project was due next week, i completely forgot about this project due to the stress of the game project deadline approaching, as well as the Easter break. I didn't have much confidence in completing the arduino project as i couldn't get a basic grasp of SDL and struggled with arduino circuity as it was very new to me. i tried to over come this by trying to teach myself and read up on SDL but again it took me too long to understand how to use it. i should have asked lectures for more help and explain to them that im really struggling. 

## Week 11

Finishing the projects

We finally finished the game project which was great, felt like a weight have been lifted. Everyone was very happy with the finished product. we only had one problem when trying to get the final build but that was to do with art textures, but aside from that the game was finished. The Arduino project was also due in this week, i know i failed that project as i barely had any work to show but i explained i will have something ready for the re-submission and will take the 40% cap
