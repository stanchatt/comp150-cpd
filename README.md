# COMP150 - Reflective Journal to Accompany My CPD Report

You should reflect across the first 13 weeks of the course. This is the period from induction week to the Winter vacation. In your reflections, you should try to identify at least one challenge that you experienced and/or obstacle that you encountered that week. Consider which skills and/or characteristics that challenge/obstacle relates to. 

This will prove to be a considerable aid when you need to identify the most important areas of personal development in your report. Do try to keep up by completing an entry in the journal every week.

## Week 0

Induction Week and the Robot Olympiad

The robot Olympiad was very interesting and gave me good insight on what team work will be like working with my colleagues. My team was able agree on a certain type of build and work out the most efficient programming for our robot to complete a task. Whenever our robot couldn't complete a certain task, our team would discuss why and calculate a solution. The only challenging thing about the robot Olympiad was making sure our robot would drive straight

## Week 1

From Concepts to Design and Commerce, An Introduction to Python Programming and PyGame, and Computing Fundamentals

The introduction to python was very eye opening, I've never used python before so i did struggle to understand what was happening and why. However due to my friendly course mates, i was able to ask for help and explanations regarding my code. I found getting pygame up and running very simple and straight forward. I found spacechem challenging to begin with, but once i started to understand the games mechanics, i started to solve puzzles efficiently. i over came this by asking friends how to use certain symbols and other mechanics i didn't know.

## Week 2

Tinkering Graphics, the Agile Philosophy, and Journal Articles in Computing

I was very concerned starting my tinkering graphics project due to my lack of experience working with python, however my programming partner was very helpful and together we pulled through and started to slowly understand the language. But i did find the project challenging because not knowing the language means i was just stumped and useless to my partner. i will over come this by watching youtube videos based on the python language learning about the agile philosophy was also very helpful because i was able to discover ways of how our group can function.

## Week 3

Starting my Tinkering Graphics Assignment, Pitching my First Game Concept, and Version Control

I was still anxious working on my tinkering graphics assignment, i felt like i should know what i was doing, but i found it quite challenging. Pitching my game concept was also quite challenging, i was able to come up with a game concept, however, when it came to the business side of things, i struggled because i just didn't really know how the business side works. I also got very confused using version control, however i was eager to learn it knowing how helpful it will be. I will overcome this by trying to spend as much time trying to use version control and watch videos explaining how to use it.
## Week 4

Met my Team for the Game Development Project! More Programming and Learning about Logic and Academic Writing

i was very happy when i met my team for the game development project because i know we was going to have good chemistry and be able to discuss and introduce new ideas for our game. Even though i watched some videos based on python, i still felt useless for my partner due to is knowledge on python, however he was still very helpful getting me to understand the language. I will overcome this by spending more of my time researching and trying to use python and understanding its key functions.

## Week 5

Peer-review finished and first assignment finished! Learned more about academic writing and complexity theory

In this week we learned about TeX and how to use TeX files. At first I found it very confusing using a TeX program becuase i kept forgetting to use simple codes like "\begin {document". This meant I struggled to find motivation to use TeX because it would confuse and infuriated me, however after spending a few hours using TeX and asking my colleagues for assistance, i found it easier to use and and understand and was able to implement it into my agile essay. 

## Week 6

Spent the week with my team working in the studio! Made a lot of progress on the game...

At first my team were very eager to spend time together in the studio and work on the game. The first few days we were able to have 4/5 of us to turn up and have our stand ups where we would discuss what we plan on doing that day. However, after a few days, we struggled to get more than 2/5 people into the studio, this was due to people being busy, medical issues or just lack of motivation. This meant that we became quite agitated with one another. we tried to solve this by gathering on discord and doing it from home, however this didnt solve the problem because we couldnt get everyone on discord at the same time.

## Week 7

This week we had to present our agile presentation. We found it difficult to have the presentation be a TeX file because we have never used TeX collaboratively. We solved this by firstly making the presentation with google docs which meant we could all do our parts and then copy it into TeX and format it and still have the google docs as a back up. unfortunately we couldnt use the TeX presenation because we didnt use github for version control, which was silly of us. We ended up using the back up google docs for our presentation

# Week 8

This week we had the Agile essay and Research journal due. I found this week very stressful because where I tunnelvisioned on the agile essay on week 7 and the game project on week 6 meant i completely forgot about the research journal. So i had to write the research journal within a few days before the deadline. This taught me that i need to learn to manage my time aswell as keep checking and refresing my mind regarding deadlines.

## Week 9

this week i unfortuanlty couldnt attend the 110 Primitive and Object Data lecture due to a doctor appointment. This means i will visit in my own time and take notes. Also during week 9 i was continuing my tinkering audio assignment. I had to redo my tinkering audio assignment because i read the brief incorrectly, which meant i did the assigntment wrong. i will avoid this in the future by thoroughly reading the assignment brief and asking colleagues for more clarification
## Week 10

This week I had the tinkering audio peer review. I feel like i was more strict than usual because of the amount practive ive had doing other peer reviews in other modules, i feel like this will help me with my own work because i will be more self critical and improve my work. I also had to present my pygame demo to investors. I was very nervous about this due to the fact that my team and i struggled to get a finished game done. We ran into many problems like overscoping and compiling code which wouldnt work. I will avoid this in the future by making sure the game is simple and easy to develop.

## Week 11

This week we started working in the unreal engine and going through the tutorial walkthrough. I was excited for this because i enjoy using the unreal engine and i feel like its a good start to making interesting games. I also learned about more Data Structures techniques, mostly Stacks and queues. I found it a little confusing at times so i will go revisit the slides in  my own time and take notes in a way that makes me understand it easier. this will help me improve my note taking skills as well as understanding techniques and information i find confusing.

## Week 12

This week i wasnt able to attend another 110 session about Further Computational Mathematics for Games, due to another doctor appointment but again i will go back and visit the session slides and take notes to help me understand the content. i will avoid missing furthur sessions by making sure i book my doctor appointments in advance and making sure there are no clashes with my timetable. This week i also had my new game pitch with my new group. i felt like this went very well because my team took a lot of time refining the game making sure it was striaght forward and easy to understand and practicing the pitch so they know what to say exactly. i helped with the pitch by contrubting to some game mechanics slides.
